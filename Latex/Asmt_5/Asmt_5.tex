B (40 points): Build a Count-Min Sketch (see L12.1.1) with k = 10 counters using t = 5 hash functions. Run it on streams S1 and S2. For both streams, report the estimated counts for objects a, b, and c. Just from the output of the sketch, which of these objects, with probably 1 - $\delta$ = 31/32 (that is assuming the randomness in the algorithm does not do something bad), might occur more than 20\% of the time?

 \begin{flushleft}
C (10 points): How would your implementation of these algorithms need to change (to answer the same questions) if each object of the stream was a “word” seen on Twitter, and the stream contained all tweets concatenated together?

So the algorithm will have to handle words and not character. You have to make decisions whether or not upper case and lower case letters are counted as the same or not. You also have to change where new words need to be broken down by, in just white spaces or other things like commas. You will also have to decide wether or not counting punctuation will count or not. Based on the way you coded it you had to handle characters, but I turned it to Strings to do the hashing, so my algorithm will not change much, but it you did not turn the char to string then you would also have to make this change. Because I turned my char to string I won't have to do much change to my code, but others will.
\end{flushleft}

 \begin{flushleft}
D (10 points): Describe one advantage of the Count-Min Sketch over the Misra-Gries Algorithm.

Count$-$Min Sketch over counts for each element so you are guaranteed to account for everything, while Misra-Gries under counts so you might mis things. In order to make sure you account for everything Count$-$Min Sketch is the best to use.
